## [Live demo](https://noam-bendelac.github.io/Course-Planner/index.html)
Select a semester color from the menu on the right (yellow = AP/transfer credit, green = 1st semester, etc.) and click on courses to mark them as being taken in that semester. Other courses' semester colors automatically adjust to maintain credits per semester and make sure all prerequisites are met.
